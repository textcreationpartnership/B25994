            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Refer the Curious Reader to our Yearly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and shall omit any Respetiation of the actions in <hi>Flanders, Holland, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> and other Countries, least you should condemn me for being tedious; I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to give you an account of my Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Predictions for the Year ensuing 1677.</p>
            <p>And we must begin with the Suns ingress into <hi>Aries,</hi> and here you will find <hi>Scorpio</hi> ascending, and <hi>Mars</hi> Lord, yet still continuing in <hi>Cancer,</hi> which seems to dispose of the actions of your Spring into some unpleasant consequence, to forraign Nations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially. Experience tells us very often, that a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net placed against â opposite unto any of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Houses, is of very bad significtion; <hi>Taurus</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:207387:3"/>and <hi>Mars</hi> to which <hi>Sol</hi> may be added, are the greatest designers of the grand transactions for the Vernal Quarter, and they seem to threaten many unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward accidents, as Robberies on Land, Man slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and Murthers, Piracies and Shipwracks at Sea, great loss to Forraign Nations by Sailors, and Rain as well as armies, the Souldiers in some places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, and are very tumultuary, for which they shall receive condigne punishments: Many distempers are like to seize Mankind, as Feavers, Frenzies, Inflamations, with some pestilential Distempers, occasioned by too much and immoderate drinking, which God Almighty prevent yet the condition; of the common people is like to be very good and fortunate this Year, and they will be happy and peaceable; the Spring season seems to encourage the Ingenious Citizen in a very good trade, which seems to flourish more them some years past, the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is very good for the Country-man, many happy showers refreshing the Corn, making his hopes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease for a happy crop.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the Summer Quarter, <hi>June</hi> the Tenth at Twenty Minutes past Midnight, is the Suns ingress into <hi>Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the 24 degree of <hi>Leo,</hi> I will not trouble my Reader with many ambiguous Words, but tell him briefly what are like to be the actions and Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations of this Quarter, if our rules fail not. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> is in opposition to <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Aquarius;</hi> the sword i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:207387:3"/>those parts, many quarrels at Sea and Land for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion are like to arise; those diseases mentioned in the Spring Quarter are like to continue, if not increase in the Summer; but I hope God Almighty will protect <hi>England</hi> from any of those miseries, which other parts are threatened withall in most Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> matters will be carried very high, as some gain, others will loose ground; the Weather is like to prove very hot, Thunders and Lightnings very frequent; yet not to prevent a propitilous Harvest, the Country-man his heart is glad, and he huggs himself with the hopes of his succeeding Crop.</p>
            <p>The Autumnal Quarter begins the 12th. of <hi>September,</hi> 3 hours, 57 minutes past midnight, then the Sun enters <hi>Libra,</hi> and who shall we find there but <hi>Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> this figure something agrees with the Spring figure, many publick Negotiations are abroad in order to peace in forraign parts, and the Sword will not reap so great a share as in the two former quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by reason we find <hi>Jupiter</hi> Lord of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant in <hi>Aquarius</hi> Rhetrograde.
